The Student Result Analyzer is a Python-based console application designed to automate the process of evaluating student academic performance.
Instead of calculating results manually, this system allows users to enter student details, subject names, and marks, and it automatically computes subject-wise grades,
total marks, percentage, overall grade, and pass/fail status.This project demonstrates the practical use of Python programming concepts such as 
functions, lists, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling. It is suitable for educational institutions to quickly analyze student results in a simple and efficient manner.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manual calculation of student results is time-consuming and prone to errors.
There is a need for a simple software solution that can:
Take student and subject details
Perform accurate calculations
Display a clear and formatted result report
